# Project Overview

This is my version of the Front-End Nanodegree project #6 - the Feed Reader.



## Installation

To run the site on your computer either clone [this repository](https://github.com/Jawan81/frontend-nanodegree-feedreader/) with Git:

```
git clone https://github.com/Jawan81/frontend-nanodegree-feedreader.git .
```

or download and unzip the [repository's archive file](https://github.com/Jawan81/frontend-nanodegree-feedreader/archive/master.zip)

Then open the index.html file in the repository with your favorite browser. No web server is required to run the project.


## Tests

The index.html file includes several tests defined with Jasmine.
The tests are automatically executed when opening index.html in the browser. You see the Jasmine test results on the butoom of
the page.

All tests are found in `jasmine/spec/feedreader.js`. 

### Additional tests

Apart from the tests required as a minimum for successful project submission additional tests were implemented
that test for future features that are not implemented yet, meaning they fail intentionally.
